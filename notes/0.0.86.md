# New features

- Removed module manifest and added that code to test folder. One problem is that the manifest structure of ShEx and SHACL is different and trying to keep both structures is only adding unneeded complexity. The manifest code is only used for testing so we removed it also from the "main" folder to clean the production code.
- Started to use scalacheck to generate RDF
