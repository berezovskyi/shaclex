# New features

Almost all ShEx validation tests pass. At this moment (29/Oct/2018) the tests that pass are 1071/1088 with 13 that fail:

- 5 Greedy tests fail. I think those tests could be removed
  PTstar-greedy-fail
  nPlus1-greedy_fail
  PstarT-greedy
  open3Onedotclosecard23_pass-p1p2p3
  PTstar-greedy-rewrite

- 1 external shape fails (I don't understand why the test should fail)
  shapeExtern_fail
  shapeExternRef_fail

- Tests with semantic actions that require me to improve semActs implementation
  startCode1fail_abort (My implementation of semantic actions is partial yet)
  startCode3fail_abort
  startCode1startReffail_abort

- Tests with REGEXP (need time to review them more carefully)
  1literalPattern_with_REGEXP_escapes_pass_bare
  1literalPattern_with_REGEXP_escapes_pass
  1literalPattern_with_REGEXP_escapes_escaped_pass
  1literalPattern_with_REGEXP_escapes_bare_pass
  1literalPattern_with_REGEXP_escapes_bare_pass_escapes

- Tests that need to import also TripleExpr references
  2EachInclude1-IS2_pass

- Test with relative shape ?
  1dot-relative_pass-short-shape
